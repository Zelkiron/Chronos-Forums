For the home page, I'm thinking of having the header of the subforum name be in dark blue.
Search functions will be in the lists in the individual pages. 
    Or I can have a universal search page.
Under profile picture and username: edit profile, messages, log out, etc
Do posts that can only be viewed by mods/admins or something
Maybe change the CSS for the wrong messages so they stand out more.

User ranking: 
-1 = banned
0 = not activated yet
1 = normal
2 = mod
3 = admin
4 = owner

Visibility ranking: 
0 = "deleted"
1 = visible to everyone
2 = only visible to mods+
3 = only visible to admins+ 

Change visiblity for createTopic for staff categories and stuff.

To-do:
- set up something in case the user did not get the email for the activation code
- prevent banned users from logging in
- memebers page
- add statuses table in db
- update topic.php to reflect refactored code
- replace all of the links with the new headers
- add these to user db: date last joined, 
- INCREMENT CATEGORY INFORMATOIN AS WELL
- limit announcement perms, add something to categories which limit what ranks can make posts
- create an alert that stands out when somethign is successful/or not 
- make OOP for topics
- thinking of making a switch for the admin panel
